\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I want to thank Professor Martin Kastner for supervising my thesis. His advice on how to structure and plan this thesis were very insightful. I felt like I had his full confidence throughout my final year.

\noindent I would also like to express my gratitude towards John Cooper, who helped me and gave me critical pieces of advice at critical times, about digital signal processing, about computer science and about writing this thesis. Thank you for being such a nice contact.
\bigskip

\noindent Also special thanks to Jari Kleimola, whose efforts to help out a random stranger from the internet I greatly appreciate. You are an excellent example of how the internet has made the world a smaller and friendlier place.
