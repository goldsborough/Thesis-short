\textbf{Name of student}: Peter Goldsborough \parbreak

\textbf{Subject of thesis}: Developing a Digital Synthesizer in C++ \parbreak

\textbf{Name of supervisor}: Prof. Martin Kastner \parbreak

\textbf{Final length of thesis}: 63349 characters \parbreak

\textbf{Reasons for trespassing of character limit}: This thesis was written with the \LaTeX{} document preparation system, which has no built-in features to calculate either the word count nor the character count. The number of characters given above was determined by converting the \LaTeX{}-generated PDF file to a TXT file and then counted using the primitive \texttt{wc} UNIX command line utility, which includes all titles, page numbers, captions, citations, equations and other non-content-characters into the character count it outputs. Therefore, it can be said that, were a proper character count possible, it is quite probable that it would approach if not fall below the 60000 character limit. Moreover, it should be mentioned that this thesis initially had over 180000 characters and was thus already reduced dramatically. It is likely that any further deletion of content would hinder the reader's understanding of the topics presented. \parbreak \parbreak \parbreak \parbreak
